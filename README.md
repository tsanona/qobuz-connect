# qobuz-connect

!The crate is not affiliated with Qobuz! 

A rust integration of the Qobuz Connect protocol. Devices appear in the device picker of the official apps, and no LAN involved.

## Usage

The cloud socket authenticates with a token the Qobuz API mints for a logged-in user. `TokenRequest::new` describes that request for any HTTP client, the crate does none, and `Credentials::from_json` reads the answer. The cloud serves one socket per token, so join with a closure that mints one before every connection:

```rust
let mut session = Session::join_with(move || mint(client.clone()), device).await?;
while let Some(event) = session.recv().await {
    if let Event::Command(command) = event {
        let state = player.apply(command);
        session.report(RendererReport::State(state))?;
    }
}
```

**Renderer:** `recv` delivers typed events: registration with the renderer id, commands for this renderer, session state, the other renderers, queue changes and errors. A set-state command is a delta: fields left out are unchanged, a track means jump to it, a bare position is a seek, a bare playing state is play or pause, a negative queue item id is stop. `report` sends state, volume, mute, quality, device info, user actions and playback errors, stamped with the queue version the session tracks. Report the track actually playing, whenever the state changes and at most every few seconds while playing: controllers extrapolate the position from the last report, and a renderer that plays without a track gets paused. `activate` makes the device the active renderer.

**Controller:** `control` sends the player state of the active renderer, the same delta, the active renderer, volume, mute, quality and loop mode of a renderer, and the queue changes: clear, load, insert, add, remove, reorder, shuffle and autoplay, or the whole queue state. Commands go out in order. A queue change carries the queue version and an action uuid, which `control` returns; the commands behind it wait for the queue event that echoes the uuid, or ten seconds. A queue error drops what is waiting and asks for the queue state again, as the apps do.

**Connection:** Sends are queued and never block; `recv` is safe to cancel. The transport reconnects with exponational backoff, minting a token each time, and treats a minute without a frame as a lost connection. `Reconnected` means the join was sent again: the renderer id, the active flag and the waiting commands are gone until the server registers the device again. Logs go through `tracing` in a span named after the device, message types at debug and payloads at trace.

## Discovery

The native apps also look for devices on the LAN: an mDNS advertisement of `_qobuz-connect._tcp` and three HTTP calls, the last of which hands the device the session and the tokens of the app's own user. That is how a device serves an account other than the one whose credentials it holds, or one without credentials at all: the API token is a bearer token for the Qobuz API, renewable at `qws/refreshToken`.
Behind the `discovery` feature, `Discovery::start` advertises a device on a port of your choice and serves the calls; each `Handover` carries credentials for `Session::join` and says whether the app expects the device to make itself active once joined, and `set_session` tells the apps which session the device is in. It needs an inbound TCP port and UDP 5353 for mDNS, where the cloud path needs only outbound TCP 443.

## Examples

All take `QOBUZ_CONNECT_ENDPOINT` and `QOBUZ_CONNECT_JWT`, which `token` produces from `QOBUZ_APP_ID` and `QOBUZ_USER_AUTH_TOKEN`:

```
eval "$(cargo run -q --example token | sh | cargo run -q --example token)"
```

- `fake_renderer` joins, prints every event, obeys commands with a simulated position and activates itself when `QOBUZ_CONNECT_ACTIVATE` is set. Pick it in a Qobuz app.
- `controller` makes the renderer named by `QOBUZ_CONNECT_RENDERER` (default `fake renderer`) active, loads the track ids in `QOBUZ_CONNECT_TRACKS`, then plays, pauses, seeks, resumes and skips, five seconds apart.
- `listen` prints every message the cloud sends; `decode` pretty-prints a captured message given as hex on stdin.
- `lan`, with `--features discovery`, advertises a fake device on `QOBUZ_CONNECT_PORT` and joins whichever session an app hands over.

One token per process: two sockets sharing one evict each other.

## Schema

`proto/qcloud.proto` is the outer frame of the cloud socket, `proto/qconnect.proto` the Qobuz Connect messages inside its payloads, both lifted from the web player so field numbers and enum values match the apps
`src/proto/` is prost output; `just regenerate` rebuilds it with protox
`docs/schema-diff.md` lists where the schema departs from the qonductor crate (used originally as the starting point)

## Disclaimer
- This repo is not affiliated with Qobuz.
- Requires a paid Qobuz subscription, or when in `--no-login` (just a recipient) mode you need the control device to have an active subscription
- You supply your own credentials
- It doesn't bypass DRM or region restrictions
- third-party Connect isn't officially supported, so use is at your own risk
